# üöï Pricing Module - Django Based Assignment

## üìå Objective

Design and build a web application with a **configurable pricing module** that supports **differential pricing**, using **Django Admin** as the UI.

---

## üìÑ Description

The Pricing Module is intended to store and manage product/service pricing and calculate final invoices based on:

- Total ride time
- Distance traveled
- Waiting time
- Day of the week

> üí° Think of this like a simplified billing system for services such as Uber/Ola.

## üóÉÔ∏è Models & Configurations

Pricing is broken down into the following components:

1. **Distance Base Price (DBP)**  
   Example:  
   - ‚Çπ80 up to 3 KMs (Tue, Wed, Thu)  
   - ‚Çπ90 up to 3.5 KMs (Sat, Mon)  
   - ‚Çπ95 up to 3.5 KMs (Sun)

2. **Distance Additional Price (DAP)**  
   Example:  
   - ‚Çπ30 per KM after 3 KMs  
   - ‚Çπ28 per KM after 3.5 KMs

3. **Time Multiplier Factor (TMF)**  
   Example:  
   - 1x under 1 hour  
   - 1.25x for 1‚Äì2 hours  
   - 2.2x for 2‚Äì3 hours

4. **Waiting Charges (WC)**  
   Example: ‚Çπ5 for every 3 minutes after initial 3 minutes
